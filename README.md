# About me
I'm a technical writer with a background in biology.

## Work

Currently, I work in higher ed. A lot of my work involves making graphs, flow charts, and other complex figures accessible. [^1]

## Projects

- I'm working on a set of guidelines for accessible technical writing in education. Over the past couple of years, a few great guidelines have popped up that cover accessible technical writing in general. These guides address many of the issues I've noted over the years, but they remain little known in my line of work or don't address challenges specific to education. [^2]
- I'm working on an online portfolio and a website on which I'll publish my guidelines for accessible technical writing in education.

[^1]: I write a lot of alt text. It would be better to link data to these figures, but that's a story for another time.
[^2]: I am not an expert in instruction or education. My perspective is that of a technical writer whose job it is to conform to a set of best practices for accessibility. On the ground level (as opposed to, say, at the level of an instructional designer or faculty member), you encounter challenges every day that standard guidelines don't address. Through finding ways to achieve the desired outcome under unique circumstances, guidelines can be updated, refined, or expanded.
