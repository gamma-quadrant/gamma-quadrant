# About me
I'm a technical writer with a background in biology.

## Work

Currently, I work in higher ed. A lot of my work involves writing alt text for images of graphs, flow charts, and other complex figures. [^1] I also edit various document components (text and graphics, mostly) for Section 508 compliance.

## Projects

- I'm writing a book about accessible technical writing for education. Over the past couple of years, a few great guidelines have popped up that outline accessible technical writing in general. These guides address many of the issues I've noted over the years, but many of these guidelines either remain unknown in my line of work or don't address challenges specific to education. [^2]
- I'm learning frontend web development for a career change, but some understanding of web development is increasingly needed for jobs that just a few years ago didn't require an internet connection (at least not for the bulk of the work). Also, it's fun.

[^1]: It would be better if the data used to create these figures were included instead.
[^2]: I am not an expert in instruction or education. My perspective is that of a technical writer whose job it is to conform to a set of best practices for accessibility. On the ground level (as opposed to, say, at the level of an instructional designer or faculty member), you encounter challenges every day that standard guidelines don't address. It is up to you to figure out how to how to achieve the desired outcome (ideally, making the info accessible) in unique circumstances.
