# About me
I'm a technical writer working on a book about accessible technical writing. I'm also a ~~grasshopper~~ frontend web developer. Learning is my thing.

## A little more about me

I work in higher ed, but I'm looking to move into more technical technical writing. A lot of my work involves writing with Section 508 and WCAG guidelines in mind. I have some thoughts about how to make my work better.
